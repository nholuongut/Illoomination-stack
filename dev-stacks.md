## Overview
This project consists of a Kubernetes (K8s) setup for a highly performant, headless eCommerce store. We utilize **Medusa** as the backend eCommerce engine and **Nuxt.js with Nuxt UI Pro** for the frontend. The project includes a dynamic product assembly system, tiered caching, and membership gamification. Key features include custom discount structures, geolocation-based pricing, and a sophisticated image processing workflow.

---

## Tech Stack Breakdown

### **Frontend Stack (Nuxt.js & Vercel)**:
- **Nuxt.js**: Acts as the frontend framework for building a server-side rendered (SSR) and static website.
- **Nuxt UI Pro**: Provides pre-built, customizable components optimized for eCommerce use.
- **Vercel**: Hosting for the frontend, providing SSR or SSG deployment options.
- **GraphQL**: Facilitates efficient data communication between Nuxt.js (frontend) and Medusa (backend).
- **Cloudflare**: Provides CDN services for static content delivery and enhanced website security.
- **Thumbor** or **Sharp**: Image processing tools used to dynamically generate web-optimized product images.
- **Redis**: Caching layer used to store transient data and API responses for faster product and page loads.

### **Backend Stack (Medusa on Kubernetes)**:
- **Medusa**: A modular eCommerce backend that manages products, variations, and orders.
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for Medusa's API handling and backend services.
- **PostgreSQL**: The primary database for storing relational data (e.g., products, variants, orders).
- **Redis**: Serves as the primary cache for product variations, API requests, and data retrieval across all services.
- **Kubernetes**: Manages containerized services, including Medusa, ensuring high availability and auto-scaling based on load.
- **Docker**: Used for containerizing backend services like Medusa, PostgreSQL, and auxiliary tools.

## Key Features

### 1. **Dynamic Product Assembly**
- Medusa handles dynamic product variants such as motifs, colors, and sizes.
- The frontend queries product data from Medusa via **GraphQL**, dynamically displaying combinations without bloating the database.
- Product images are generated and compressed using **Sharp** or **Thumbor**, with options for motif size and placement.

### 2. **Geolocation-Based Pricing**
- Pricing adjusts based on user location (detected via IP), showing either EUR or USD, with real-time currency conversion and localized pricing.
- Implemented using **GeoIP** services integrated with the frontend, with pricing data pulled from Medusa.

### 3. **Custom Discount Structure**
- Discounts are dynamic and stackable:
  - **Timed Discounts**: Limited-time reductions on specific products.
  - **Membership Discounts**: Discounts that scale with membership tier.
  - **Seasonal or Campaign-Specific Discounts**: Automatically applied via campaign rules set in Medusa.
- Discounts are configured in Medusa and applied dynamically based on customer interaction and tier.

### 4. **Caching System in Tiers**
**Caching Strategy**:
- **Tier S (Transients)**: Frequently accessed products (e.g., during campaigns) are cached in Redis for immediate access.
- **Tier 1**: Products with high user interaction are cached with a grace period.
- **Tier 2**: Products with lower traffic have image data purged but core data retained.
- **Tier 3**: Least-accessed products retain only default images and essential data, dynamically reassembled on request.

**Temporary Transients**: Special-case products (e.g., during marketing pushes) can be manually cached at a higher tier temporarily.

### 5. **Membership and Gamification**
- **Membership Levels**:
  - **Tier I (Free)**: Access to exclusive offers, Cotton Credits, and 1 monthly giveaway ticket.
  - **Tier II (Paid, â‚¬28/year)**: Free Tee, discounts, more Cotton Credits, and 2 giveaway tickets/month.
  - **Tier III (Subscription, â‚¬28/month)**: Monthly free T-shirt (13/year), deepest discounts, maximum credits, 3 giveaway tickets/month.
- **Monthly Giveaway**: Users receive tickets based on their membership tier and can win prizes each month.
- **Cotton Credits (or Loominous Points)**: Earned from purchases, usable for discounts, free items, or additional giveaway tickets.
- **Gamification**: Achievements and loyalty tiers provide additional perks and discounts based on user engagement.

## Server Architecture & Setup

### **Kubernetes Cluster (Backend & Frontend Services)**
- **Cluster Nodes**:
  - **Nodes**: 2x 1GB RAM nodes ($5/month each) to start, scaling automatically with increased load.
  - **Horizontal Scaling**: Kubernetes ensures additional nodes are added when traffic spikes.
  - **Pod Deployment**: Medusa, Nuxt.js, PostgreSQL, Redis, and auxiliary services run as containerized pods.
- **Managed PostgreSQL Database**: Provisioned for scalability and automatic backups ($15-20/month).
- **Load Balancer**: Deployed within the Kubernetes cluster to manage traffic efficiently.

### **Frontend Hosting**
- **Vercel (Free Plan)**: Hosts the **Nuxt.js** frontend, providing SSR or SSG deployment options.
- **Edge Functions**: Utilize **Vercel Edge Functions** to run server-side logic closer to the user, enhancing responsiveness.

### **CDN & Security**
- **Cloudflare Free Plan**: Provides global CDN, SSL/TLS, and DDoS protection.
- **Advanced Security**: Use **Cloudflare Pro** or **Business Plan** at higher levels of traffic for enhanced security and performance.

### **Auxiliary Services**
- **Mautic (Email Marketing)**: Deployed within the Kubernetes cluster for automated email marketing campaigns.
- **Postal (Transactional Emails)**: Handles order confirmations and other transactional communications, also deployed in the Kubernetes environment.

## Performance Goals

- **API Response Time**: Target 10â€“50ms via optimized Redis caching.
- **Time to First Byte (TTFB)**: 50â€“100ms.
- **Full Page Load (with Caching)**: <1 second.
- **Product Variation Load**: Cached product variations should load within 0.2â€“0.4 seconds.

---

## DevOps, Monitoring & Maintenance

1. **CI/CD Pipelines**: 
   - Continuous integration and deployment using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.
   - Automated testing and staging before live deployment.
   
2. **Monitoring & Alerts**:
   - **Prometheus** or **Grafana** for cluster and API monitoring.
   - **Custom Alerts**: Alerts for high load, slow queries, and downtime.

3. **Security**:
   - **SSL Certificates** via **Let's Encrypt** managed through Kubernetes Ingress.
   - Secure Kubernetes pods and services using **Network Policies** and **RBAC** (Role-Based Access Control).
   - **Container Scanning**: Implement tools such as **Clair** or **Trivy** to scan container images for vulnerabilities.

---

## Cost Breakdown

### Kubernetes & Hosting:
- **Kubernetes Nodes**: 2 x 1GB nodes ($5/month each) = $10/month (scales as needed)
- **Managed PostgreSQL**: $15-20/month
- **Vercel (Nuxt.js Hosting)**: Free Plan (initially)
- **Cloudflare (CDN & Security)**: Free Plan (initially)
- **Total**: $25-30/month (starting cost, scaling with usage)

### Additional Costs:
- **Nuxt UI Pro License**: â‚¬250 (one-time fee)
- **Custom Development** (if outsourcing for API integration or advanced features): Varies based on hourly rates.

## Conclusion
This project integrates **Medusa** and **Nuxt.js** within a **Kubernetes** architecture to create a highly scalable and resilient eCommerce solution. It combines dynamic product assembly, optimized caching, advanced pricing mechanisms, and an engaging membership system to provide a seamless shopping experience. The Kubernetes-based infrastructure ensures resilience and scalability, allowing for growth as traffic and customer demand increase.
